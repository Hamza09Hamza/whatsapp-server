#  What's app like Chat — Quick Overview

A compact summary of the  Chat project (frontend + server).

**What it is**
- This is a WhatsApp-like realtime messaging app with private/group chat, delivery/read receipts, and audio/video calling using a Mediasoup SFU.

**Key Features**
- Real-time messaging (private and group)
- Message delivery & read receipts
- In-app call signaling + Mediasoup SFU for audio/video
- Server-side automatic call recording
- Admin approval flow for new users

**Tech Stack**
- Server: Node.js + Express + Socket.IO
- Media: Mediasoup SFU 
- Database: PostgreSQL

**Quick Start (high-level)**
- run the server in `server/` (uses `.env` for DB and ports). Server exposes REST endpoints and Socket.IO events.

**Important Socket Events (summary)**
- `register_user` — client registers socket to server
- `send_private_message` / `receive_private_message` — private messaging
- `send_group_message` / `receive_group_message` — group messaging
- `call_user` → `incoming_call` → `answer_call` → `call_accepted` — call signaling flow
- `message_status_update` — delivery/read status updates

**Call Flow (3 phases)**
- `calling` → server delivers `incoming_call` to callee
- `ringing` → server can emit `call_ringing` to notify the caller when the callee's device received the incoming call
- `connected` → after `answer_call` and mediasoup join, media flows via SFU

**Database & Recording**
- PostgreSQL stores users, rooms, messages, message_status (receipts), calls, and recordings.
- When media producers exist in a call, the server can auto-start FFmpeg-based recording stored under `server/recordings/`.

**Where to look next**
- Server entry: `server/server.js`
- Mediasoup: `server/mediaServer.js`

**Notes for developers**
- Socket auth and production hardening (HTTPS, JWT verification, CORS, rate limits) are recommended before deploying.

**License & Credits**
- Internal project; adapt licensing as needed.
